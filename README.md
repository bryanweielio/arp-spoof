# arp-spoof
A python 2.7 program written to manipulate protocols on layer 2 of OSI model. It effectively places you as MITM in connection. 

## Getting Started
To run this program, you should already be in the network (wireless or wired). This program effectively updates the ARP tables on both the router and the target. 

## Running the program
Written in python 2.7, make sure to use the appropriate interrupter. You should know the IPs of router and target. Do an Nmap scan if unknown.

## Attention
Please do not use this program where unauthorized.
